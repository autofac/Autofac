Type Interceptors
=================

DynamicProxy2, part of the from `the Castle Project core <http://castleproject.org>`_, provides a method interception framework.

The ``Autofac.Extras.DynamicProxy2`` integration package enables method calls on Autofac components to be intercepted by other components. Common use-cases are transaction handling, logging, and declarative security.

Enabling Interception
=====================

The basic steps to get DynamicProxy2 integration working are:

- :ref:`create_interceptors`
- :ref:`register_interceptors`
- :ref:`enable_type_interception`
- :ref:`associate_interceptors`

.. _create_interceptors:

Create Interceptors
-------------------
Interceptors implement the ``Castle.DynamicProxy.IInterceptor`` interface. Here's a simple interceptor example that logs method calls including inputs and outputs:

.. sourcecode:: csharp

    public class CallLogger : IInterceptor
    {
      TextWriter _output;

      public CallLogger(TextWriter output)
      {
        _output = output;
      }

      public void Intercept(IInvocation invocation)
      {
        _output.Write("Calling method {0} with parameters {1}... ",
          invocation.Method.Name,
          string.Join(", ", invocation.Arguments.Select(a => (a ?? "").ToString()).ToArray()));

        invocation.Proceed();

        _output.WriteLine("Done: result was {0}.", invocation.ReturnValue);
      }
    }

.. _register_interceptors:

Register Interceptors with Autofac
----------------------------------

Interceptors must be registered with the container. You can register them either as typed services or as named services. If you register them as named services, they must be named ``IInterceptor`` registrations.

Which of these you choose depends on how you decide to associate interceptors with the types being intercepted.

.. sourcecode:: csharp

    // Named registration
    builder.Register(c => new CallLogger(Console.Out))
           .Named<IInterceptor>("log-calls");

    // Typed registration
    builder.Register(c => new CallLogger(Console.Out));

.. _enable_type_interception:

Enable Interception on Types
----------------------------

When you register a type being intercepted, you have to mark the type at registration time so Autofac knows to wire up that interception. You do this using the ``EnableInterfaceInterceptors()`` and ``EnableClassInterceptors()`` registration extensions.

.. sourcecode:: csharp

    var builder = new ContainerBuilder();
    builder.RegisterType<SomeType>()
           .As<ISomeInterface>()
           .EnableInterfaceInterceptors();
    builder.Register(c => new CallLogger(Console.Out));
    var container = builder.Build();
    var willBeIntercepted = container.Resolve<ISomeInterface>();

Under the covers, ``EnableInterfaceInterceptors()`` creates an interface proxy that performs the interception, while ``EnableClassInterceptors()`` dynamically subclasses the target component to perform interception of virtual methods.

Both techniques can be used in conjunction with the assembly scanning support, so you can configure batches of components using the same methods.

**Special case: WCF proxy and remoting objects**
While WCF proxy objects *look* like interfaces, the ``EnableInterfaceInterceptors()`` mechanism won't work because, behind the scenes, .NET is actually using a ``System.Runtime.Remoting.TransparentProxy`` object that behaves like the interface. If you want interception on a WCF proxy, you need to use the ``InterceptTransparentProxy()`` method.

.. sourcecode:: csharp

    var cb = new ContainerBuilder();
    cb.RegisterType<TestServiceInterceptor>();
    cb.Register(c => CreateChannelFactory()).SingleInstance();
    cb
      .Register(c => c.Resolve<ChannelFactory<ITestService>>().CreateChannel())
      .InterceptTransparentProxy(typeof(IClientChannel))
      .InterceptedBy(typeof(TestServiceInterceptor))
      .UseWcfSafeRelease();

.. _associate_interceptors:

Associate Interceptors with Types to be Intercepted
---------------------------------------------------

To pick which interceptor is associated with your type, you have two choices.

Your first option is to mark the type with an attribute, like this:

.. sourcecode:: csharp

    // This attribute will look for a TYPED
    // interceptor registration:
    [Intercept(typeof(CallLogger))]
    public class First
    {
      public virtual int GetValue()
      {
        // Do some calculation and return a value
      }
    }

    // This attribute will look for a NAMED
    // interceptor registration:
    [Intercept("log-calls")]
    public class Second
    {
      public virtual int GetValue()
      {
        // Do some calculation and return a value
      }
    }

When you use attributes to associate interceptors, you don't need to specify the interceptor at registration time. You can just enable interception and the interceptor type will automatically be discovered.

.. sourcecode:: csharp

    // Using the TYPED attribute:
    var builder = new ContainerBuilder();
    builder.RegisterType<First>()
           .EnableClassInterceptors();
    builder.Register(c => new CallLogger(Console.Out));

    // Using the NAMED attribute:
    var builder = new ContainerBuilder();
    builder.RegisterType<Second>()
           .EnableClassInterceptors();
    builder.Register(c => new CallLogger(Console.Out))
           .Named<IInterceptor>("log-calls");

The second option is to declare the interceptor at Autofac registration time. You can do this using the ``InterceptedBy()`` registration extension:

.. sourcecode:: csharp

    var builder = new ContainerBuilder();
    builder.RegisterType<SomeType>()
           .EnableClassInterceptors()
           .InterceptedBy(typeof(CallLogger));
    builder.Register(c => new CallLogger(Console.Out));

Tips
====

Use Public Interfaces
---------------------

Interface interception requires the interface be public. Non-public interface types can't be intercepted.
Note: Alternatively you can also use `internal` and add `[assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("DynamicProxyGenAssembly2")]` to the `AssemblyInfo.cs`.

Use Virtual Methods
-------------------

Class interception requires the methods being intercepted to be virtual since it uses subclassing as the proxy technique.

Usage with Expressions
----------------------

Components created using expressions, or those registered as instances, cannot be subclassed by the DynamicProxy2 engine. In these cases, it is necessary to use interface-based proxies.

Interface Registrations
-----------------------

To enable proxying via interfaces, the component must provide its services through interfaces only. For best performance, all such service interfaces should be part of the registration, i.e. included in ``As<X>()`` clauses.

WCF Proxies
-----------

As mentioned earlier, WCF proxies and other remoting types are special cases and can't use standard interface or class interception. You must use ``InterceptTransparentProxy()`` on those types.

Class Interceptors and UsingConstructor
---------------------------------------

If you are using class interceptors via ``EnableClassInterceptors()`` then avoid using the constructor selector ``UsingConstructor()`` with it. When class interception is enabled, the generated proxy adds some new constructors that also take the set of interceptors you want to use. When you specify ``UsingConstructor()`` you'll bypass this logic and your interceptors won't be used.
