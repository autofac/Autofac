Using Glimpse
-------------
Thank you for NuGetting Glimpse, A client side Glimpse into what's going on in your server.

Glimpse is currently in Beta.

If you experience any issues, or have feature requests, please report them to https://github.com/Glimpse/Glimpse/issues

To get started with Glimpse, visit [http://yoursite.com]/Glimpse.axd This page hosts the Glimpse bookmarklets, useful for quickly turning on Glimpse.

The following configuration values are allowed for Glimpse in your web.config:

<glimpse enabled="true" 
	requestLimit="5" 
	loggingEnabled="false"
	ipForwardingEnabled="false"
	cacheEnabled="true"> 
	<!-- 
		set enabled to false to completely turn off Glimpse. 
		requestLimit specifies the max number of requests Glimpse will save. 
		enableLogging (false by default) if you experience problems with Glimpse 
		ipForwardingEnabled (false by default) will force Glimpse to validate IP addresses based on the value in the HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR header. Useful if your server is behind a proxy or load balancer.
		cacheEnabled (true by default) Glimpse will tell browsers to cache static files by default
	-->
    <ipAddresses> <!-- List of IP addresses allowed to get Glimpse data. Optional. localhost (IPv4 & IPv6) by default -->
        <add address="127.0.0.1" />
        <add address="::1" />
    </ipAddresses>
    <contentTypes><!-- List of content types Glimpse will provide data for. Optional  text/html and application/json by default -->
        <add contentType="text/html"/>
    </contentTypes>
    <pluginBlacklist><!-- List of plugins for Glimpse to ignore. Optional. By default all plugins will load -->
		<add plugin="Glimpse.Core.Plugin.Request"/>
		<add plugin="Glimpse.Core.Plugin.MetaData"/>
	</pluginBlacklist>
	<environments><!-- List of environments your application runs in. Used for the new environment switcher feature. Optional. By default environment information will no be shown -->
        <add name="Dev" authority="localhost:33333" />
        <add name="Prod" authority="getglimpse.com" />
    </environments>
	<urlBlacklist><!-- Glimpse will ignore all requests made to URI's that match any regular expression in this list. Optional. By default all URI's will be considered for Glimpse inspection. -->
		<add url="{regex}"/>
		<add url="{regex}"/>
	</urlBlacklist>
</glimpse>

Overview
--------
At its core Glimpse allows you to debug your web site, and get diagnostics information right in the browser. Glimpse allows you to "Glimpse" into what's going on in your web server. In other words what Firebug is to debugging your client side code, Glimpse is to debugging your server within the client.

Fundamentally Glimpse is made up of 3 different parts, all of which are extensible and customizable for any platform:

* Glimpse Server Module 
* Glimpse Client Side Viewer 
* Glimpse Protocol


How it Works
------------
On the Server:

1. Server collects all server side information that will aid in debugging (i.e. application settings, routes, session variables, trace data, etc)
2. It does this by running through a pipeline of server side data providers that can be dynamically controlled and added to under our plugin architecture
3. Before the response is sent, the server formats this data in accordance with the Glimpse Protocol and serializes it as JSON
4. Depending on whether it is an Ajax request or not, the server embeds the JSON in the content of the page

On the Client:

5. Depending on whether it is a Ajax request or not, the client picks up the JSON data and displays the it by executing a pipeline of client side data providers that can be dynamically controlled and added to under our plugin architecture
6. The client side module then dynamically renders a client side UI (similar to Firebug Lite) that lets you view this data

Glimpse can be turned on or off by a series of different mechanisms, but at its core if the Glimpse cookie is present the server will provide the "debug" data - as a security measure, the request for debug data is "authenticated".

 
Server Implementations 
----------------------
Given the scope of the project and what it can do, the concept isn't restricted to any one platform. Hence, once mature, Glimpse Server Module will be available on all major web platforms. 

Platforms currently supported:

* ASP.Net MVC 3 (via Glimpse.Mvc3 package)
* ASP.Net Web Forms 4 (via Glimpse package)

Platforms target to be supported:

* PHP
* Ruby on Rails 

NOTE - If you would like help develop a Glimpse Server Module for a given platform please let us know.


Client Implementations 
----------------------
To start with the Glimpse Client Side Viewer is simply a light weight JavaScript "plugin" that understands the Glimpse Protocol and knows how to render the data. From a technology standpoint we currently use jQuery as the client side framework.

Eventually, we would like to have actual browser plugins that provide richer functionality and experience, but the JavaScript version of the Glimpse Client Side Viewer is surprisingly well featured, intuitive and provides a high fidelity experience. We also hope to have a version for mobile ready soon which customizes the viewing/usage experience when using a mobile device.
