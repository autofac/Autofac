    <!-- Don't catch general exceptions - test scenarios sometimes require general exception handling. -->
    <Rule Id="CA1031" Action="None" />
    <!-- Implement standard exception constructors - not all of the exception constructors (e.g., parameterless) are desired in our system. -->
    <Rule Id="CA1032" Action="None" />
    <!-- Avoid empty interfaces - in unit tests for service resolution, this happens a lot. -->
    <Rule Id="CA1040" Action="None" />
    <!-- Do not pass literals as localized parameters  - tests don't need to localize. -->
    <Rule Id="CA1303" Action="None" />

    <!-- Remove the underscores from member name - unit test scenarios may use underscores. -->
    <Rule Id="CA1707" Action="None" />
    <!-- Change names to avoid reserved word overlaps (e.g., Delegate, GetType, etc.) - too many of these in the public API, we'd break if we fixed it. -->
    <Rule Id="CA1716" Action="None" />
    <!-- Internal class that appears to never be instantiated - lots of false positives here because they're test stubs created by Autofac registrations. -->
    <Rule Id="CA1812" Action="None" />
    <!-- Change Dispose() to call GC.SuppressFinalize - in tests we don't really care and it can impact readability. -->

    <!-- Seal internal types for performance - in tests we don't really care and it gets painful to enforce. -->
    <Rule Id="CA1852" Action="None" />

    <Rule Id="CA1861" Action="None" />
